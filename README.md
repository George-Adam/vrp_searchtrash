# vrp_searchtrash
This requires Dunko`s VRP v6.7.

With this script, you can search almost all trash cans/dumpsters and find different food items or cash.

To add it to your server, move it to your resources folder then add 'ensure vrp_searchtrash' in your server.cfg.

Disclaimer: This script may not be unique, but it was wrote 100% by me. Also, this was the first script made by me, so, sorry for the mistakes, if there are any.  

If you have any questions or issues, create an issue and I`ll answer back ASAP.
